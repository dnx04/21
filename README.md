# 21 Online

**21 Online** is a web-based online multiplayer variation of Blackjack ~~that has never been seen before.~~

This is a submission to the *iNTUition v9.0* hackathon.

## Build instructions

You will need Node.js v18 and npm installed.

Clone the project to the directory of your choice, then run these commands inside the directory: 

```
npm run build
npm start
```

This will create a server at `localhost:3001`, from which you can access the game.
